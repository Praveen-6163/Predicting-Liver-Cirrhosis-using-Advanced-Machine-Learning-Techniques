# 🧪 Predicting Liver Cirrhosis using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can **predict liver cirrhosis** based on medical attributes such as bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, protein levels, and more. The model is deployed using **Flask** with a simple web interface.
